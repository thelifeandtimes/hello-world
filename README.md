# hello-world
this is the place to learn about what thelifeandtimes is doing.

Really, this is going to explore the journey of my attempt at learning to code and the everlasting journey towards digital sovereignty. 

The programming related items that are currently on my to-do list are:
1. Learn Hoon and better understand the Urbit architecture
2. Learn Git and how to utilize GitHub as a developer tool and project management platform
3. Brush up HTML and CSS skills from way back when
4. Learn Javascript and React.JS
5. Learn Figma

I am working on these skills so that I can execute the following endeavors:
- run my urbit on a rPi4 and include a BTC full node and self-hosted S3 bucket.
- contribute to the Urbit project and acquire a star through the grant or apprenticeship program
- build a useful tool on urbit for running human scale businesses
